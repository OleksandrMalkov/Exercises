/*5.21 (Find the Largest Number) The process of finding the maximum value (i.e., the largest of
       a group of values) is used frequently in computer applications. For example, an app that determines
       the winner of a sales contest would input the number of units sold by each salesperson. The salesperson who sells the most units wins the contest. 
       Write pseudocode, then a C# app that inputs a
       series of 10 integers, then determines and displays the largest integer. Your app should use at least
       the following three variables:
            a) counter: A counter to count to 10 (i.e., to keep track of how many numbers have been
            input and to determine when all 10 numbers have been processed).
            b) number: The integer most recently input by the user.
            c) largest: The largest number found so far.

while counter is less than or equal to 10
    prompt the user to enter the next integer
    if the input integer largest than largest
        change value the largest by input integer
