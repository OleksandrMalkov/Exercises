/*12.13 (Polymorphic Banking Program Using Account Hierarchy) Develop a polymorphic banking app using the Account hierarchy created in Exercise 11.8. 
        Create an array of Account references to SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount objects. For each Account in the array, allow the user to specify an amount of money
        to withdraw from the Account using method Debit and an amount of money to deposit into the Account using method Credit. As you process each Account, determine its type.
        If an Account is a SavingsAccount, calculate the amount of interest owed to the Account using method CalculateInterest, then add the interest to the account balance using method Credit.
        After processing an Account, display the updated account balance obtained by using baseclass property Balance.
